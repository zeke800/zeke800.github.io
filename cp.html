<h2 style="color:red">About us</h2>
<p>We are a music group based in Toronto. We publish some music sometimes on Spotify. Unfortunately, while our new single that was a hit when we shared it with our inside community,
"The Soft Munch", we messed things up with the distribution settings, so it won't come out until the 24th of December (Christmas Eve). </p>
