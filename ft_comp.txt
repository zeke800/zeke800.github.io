FT_Comp. 

This is one of my finest HRPT composites. I do believe it outperforms most others. The green color has been calibrated (as closely as possible) to AQUA and TERRA data. Seems mostly ok. 

FT_comp is written for LeanHRPT, although will be ported into satdump sooner or later. Paste this into the preset definition file.

Naming

Originally, it was called frickin' terrible composite (due to how terrible it was), but now is False True Color Composite.
